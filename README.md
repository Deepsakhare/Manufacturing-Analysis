**Manufacturing Analysis Dashboard in Excel**

**Responsibilities** 

**Data Analysis & Reporting:**

Created a comprehensive manufacturing analysis dashboard in Microsoft Excel to track key production metrics, including total production value, manufactured quantity, rejected quantity average, processed quantity, daily machine usage, and production efficiency.
Visualization and Insights:
Designed dynamic and interactive graphs to represent production trends and KPIs, such as:
Top 10 employees with the highest rejection rates.
Daily and cumulative production metrics.
Machine-wise wastage and performance efficiency.
Used bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to enhance data visualization and understanding.
Performance Metrics:
Automated calculations for production efficiency, wastage analysis, and rejection rates, enabling real-time decision-making for manufacturing improvements.
Analyzed employee-wise rejection data to highlight process bottlenecks and opportunities for process optimization.
Technical Proficiency:
Utilized advanced Excel functions (e.g., PivotTables, VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, conditional formatting) to handle large datasets efficiently.
Implemented macros for automation and improved reporting speed.
Ensured data accuracy and integrity through rigorous data validation techniques.
Impact on Operations:
Reduced manual reporting time by 50% by automating daily production reports.
Improved operational efficiency by providing actionable insights on employee and machine performance.
Team Collaboration:
Collaborated with the production and quality assurance teams to identify key metrics for analysis.
Presented dashboards and insights to senior management, influencing data-driven decisions.
